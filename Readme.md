### Project Title: 
    On the Assessment of Several Regression-Based Machine Learning Approaches in Runoff Prediction

### Project Description: 
    In this research a number of data driven (machine learning) have been implemented to predict sequential
    flow rate values based on a set of collected runoff factors in Steven Creek Watershed, SC, USA.

### Dependencies:
    scikitlearn
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
